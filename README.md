# Remix Indie Stack

## Quickstart

- Install the NPM packages required for the project:

  ```sh
  npm i
  ```

- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` so that the code can read your important project secret tokens and database locations.

- Initial setup - build a starter database:

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
